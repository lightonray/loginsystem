# loginsystem
This project is built using the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in PHP.

Key components of the system include:

User Class: The User class represents a user in the system. It encapsulates properties like username, password, and email. It also includes methods for user registration, login, and logout.

Database Class: The Database class handles the database operations required for user management. It establishes a connection to the database and provides methods for executing queries, fetching results, and inserting or updating user data.

Session Class: The Session class manages the user's session throughout their interaction with the system. It handles tasks like starting a new session, storing user data, and destroying the session upon logout.

Validation Class: The Validation class contains functions for validating user input. It ensures that the data entered during registration or login meets the specified criteria, such as minimum password length or valid email format.



Please note that this is a simplified description, and in practice, a complete login system would involve additional considerations such as password encryption, password recovery mechanisms, and more sophisticated user management features.
